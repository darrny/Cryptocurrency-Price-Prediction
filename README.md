# Bitcoin Price Prediction Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning model to predict Bitcoin prices using historical data. It utilizes LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to analyze 5 years of historical price data and generate 30-day price forecasts with confidence intervals.

## Features
- Historical data analysis and visualization
- Price prediction using deep learning
- Confidence interval calculation
- Pattern recognition and trend analysis
- Interactive visualizations
- Multiple simulation support

## Technologies Used

### Programming Languages
- Python 3.8+

### Main Libraries
- **TensorFlow** (2.x): Deep learning framework for model creation and training
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations and array operations
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **scikit-learn**: Data preprocessing and metrics calculation

### APIs
- **yfinance**: Yahoo Finance API wrapper for historical cryptocurrency data

### Key Concepts
1. **Deep Learning**
   - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks
   - Sequential modeling
   - Dropout for regularization
   - Multi-layer neural networks

2. **Time Series Analysis**
   - Sequence prediction
   - Pattern recognition
   - Trend analysis
   - Volatility modeling
   - Fourier analysis for cycle detection

3. **Data Processing**
   - Data normalization
   - Sequence creation
   - Train-test splitting
   - Feature scaling

4. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Confidence intervals
   - Monte Carlo simulations
   - Error metrics (RMSE)
   - Volatility calculation

## Model Architecture
- Input Layer: 120-day lookback period
- LSTM Layer 1: 100 units with dropout
- LSTM Layer 2: 75 units with dropout
- LSTM Layer 3: 50 units with dropout
- Dense Layer: 25 units with ReLU activation
- Output Layer: 1 unit (price prediction)

## Prediction Methodology
1. Historical Pattern Analysis
   - Volatility calculation
   - Cycle detection using Fourier analysis
   - Trend extraction

2. Multiple Simulation Approach
   - 100 simulations per prediction
   - Combination of:
     - Historical trends
     - Cyclical patterns
     - Volatility-based randomness

3. Confidence Interval Calculation
   - Based on simulation distribution
   - Represents model uncertainty

## Limitations and Considerations
- Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile
- External factors not captured by the model:
  - Regulatory changes
  - Market sentiment
  - Global economic events
  - Technical developments
- Predictions should not be used as financial advice
- Past performance doesn't guarantee future results

## Future Improvements
- Integration of sentiment analysis
- Additional technical indicators
- Support for multiple cryptocurrencies
- Real-time data updates
- API endpoint for predictions
- Enhanced visualization options
